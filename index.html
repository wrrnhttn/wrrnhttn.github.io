          My name is Warren Hatton. I've spent most of my life being
          a software developer, working on applied computational geometry
          for geospatial, AR, and robotics applications.

          I am currently focused on re-entering the world of academic
          philosophy and mathematics, with an emphasis on
          non-classical logics, proof assistants,
          mathematical structuralism, and automatic differentiation.
        </p>

          I also occasionally find myself accidentally thinking too hard
          about virtue ethics.

          I like to play the guitar and make music with computers.
